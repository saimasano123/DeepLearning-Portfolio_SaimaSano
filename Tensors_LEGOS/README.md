# Assignment A04 – Understanding Tensors through LEGO

## Overview
This assignment explains tensors—the building blocks of deep learning—using a LEGO analogy. The visual and physical metaphor simplifies the understanding of scalar, vector, matrix, and higher-order tensors.

## What I Did
- Translated tensor concepts into physical LEGO structures.
- Explained scalar (single block), vector (row), matrix (grid), and tensor (stacked layers).
- Related tensors to their use in machine learning and AI applications.

## Key Takeaways
- Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays essential for neural networks.
- The LEGO analogy made abstract math concepts tangible.
- Real-world examples like video games and image processing depend heavily on tensors.
