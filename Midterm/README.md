# Midterm â€“ Creating images through Diffusion Model

## Overview
This assignment was understand, implement, and evaluate the process of generating images using diffusion models.

## What I Did
- Researched the theoretical foundations and working principles of diffusion models (e.g., forward and reverse diffusion processes, denoising autoencoders).
- Explored different architectures and techniques for training diffusion models (e.g., DDPM, latent diffusion).
- Implemented or utilized pre-trained diffusion models to generate novel images, potentially including variations or specific themes.
- Analyzed the quality, diversity, and coherence of the generated images, identifying strengths and limitations of the models.

## Key Takeaways
- Diffusion models represent a powerful and rapidly evolving paradigm for high-fidelity image synthesis.
- The iterative denoising process allows for fine-grained control and impressive detail in generated outputs.
- Understanding the interplay between noise, time steps, and neural network architectures is crucial for effective implementation.
- Diffusion models offer significant potential for creative applications and advancements in various image-related tasks.
