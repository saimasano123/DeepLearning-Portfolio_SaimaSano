# Assignment A03 – Neural Network Zoo: Animal-Inspired Architectures

## Overview
This creative assignment involved exploring and categorizing various neural network architectures by comparing them to animals in a zoo. Each neural network type was matched with an animal that reflects its key abilities, making the technical concepts more intuitive and engaging.

## Objective
To explore, compare, and analyze various neural network architectures, drawing parallels to animal characteristics within a "neural network zoo."

## What I Did
- Researched the origins, components, and real-world applications of multiple neural network types.
- Assigned animal analogies to each architecture to represent their unique strengths:
  - **Eagle**: Pattern Spotter (CNN – Convolutional Neural Network)
  - **Owl**: Memory Keeper (Autoencoder) and others
  - Designed a creative framework that communicates deep learning diversity using visual metaphors.

## Key Takeaways
- Each neural network architecture is uniquely suited for specific types of tasks and data, just as animals are adapted to specific environments.
- Understanding how these architectures "behave" helps with choosing the right model for the right problem.
- The "Neural Network Zoo" analogy serves as a memorable and educational tool to grasp complex AI concepts more easily.
